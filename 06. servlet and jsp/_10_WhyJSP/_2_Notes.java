    NOTES:
    - How JSP Translated into Servlets ?

    - You can only write code in Jsp but not run code in jsp. WHen working with Tomcat we have servlets which run on Tomcat. This is possible because Tomcat is also called a servlet container. Meaning in Tomcat you can only only run Servlets and not jsp

    - ANy jsp code written has to be converted into servlet for it to be able to run in Tomcat. The only advantage of jsp is that it;s eacy for developer to interact with both HTML and java code

    - If you want to show data on the page, use jsp. If you want top proccess it gor for sevlet
