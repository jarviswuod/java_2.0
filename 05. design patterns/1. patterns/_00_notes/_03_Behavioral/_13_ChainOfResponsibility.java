    NOTES:
    - Chain of Responsibility Pattern
        - Is a behavioral pattern allows you to create a chain of objects where each object can either handle a request or pass it along to the next object
        - It decouples the sender of a request from it's receiver enabling multiple objects to handle the request without explicitly specifying which object will process it


    - 2 Main actors in Chain;
        a. Handler:
            - Is an interface that defines a common interface for handling requests, it contains a reference to the next handler in the chain

        b. Concrete Handler:
            - Is a subclass or handler that implements special request processing logic


    - Advantages and Disadvantages
        - Advantages:
            - Decoupling: It separates the sender and receiver. This separation allows for modification or the addition of handlers without any need to alter the client code
            - Flexibility: It provides a dynamic and adaptable method for processing requests. Handlers can be effortlessly added, removed or rearranged facilitation easy modification to suit changing requirements
            - Single responsibility: Each handler in the chain of responsibility focuses on a specific task adhering to the single responsibility principle resulting in better organized and more maintainable code


        - Disadvantages:
            - Order Dependency: The sequence of handlers in the chain plays a crucial role and any misplacement might lead to bugs or unexpected outcomes
            - Unprocessed Request: The risk of requests going unprocessed, If a request traverses the entire chain without being addressed it remains pending which could pose problems depending of the applications context
            - Performance Overhead: Single all the request has to go through all the handlers, it could introduce a performance overhead especially if the chain is lengthy
