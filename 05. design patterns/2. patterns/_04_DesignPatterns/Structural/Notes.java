    NOTES:
    - Structural design patterns:
        - These patterns primarily deal with how classes and objects can be combined to form larger, more complex structures while keeping the very structures flexible and efficient
        - The key objective of the structural design pattern is to provide solutions to design problems related to objects composition and structure, allowing for better organization and management of code

        - Structural design patterns help to achieve several important goals in software development
            1. Promote code reusability and modularity by defining clear and standardized ways to compose and organize classes and objects. This makes the codebase more maintainable and scalable over time, as changes or additions to the system can be made more easily
            2. Enhance flexibility and extensiblity by allowing the system's structure to evolve without requiring major changes to the exisiting code. This is achieved by decoupling the components of the system and promoting loose coupling between different parts
            3. Improve performance and resource utilization by optimizing the way objects interact and collaborate within the system, thereby enhancing overall system efficiency

        - Overall, these patterns contribute to building robust, adaptable and well-organized software systems that are easier to understand, maintain and extend over time
