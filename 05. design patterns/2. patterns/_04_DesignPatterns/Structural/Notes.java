    NOTES:
    - Strctural desgin patterns:
        - THey focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structrues and systems. These patterns primarily deal with how classes and objects can be combines to form larger, more comples strctures while keep ing these structures flexible and efficient.
        - The key objects of the structrual design pattern is to provide solutions to design problems related to objects compoeition and structure, allowing for better organization and management of code

        - Structural design patterns help to achieve several important goals in software development
            1. Promote code reusability and modularity by defining clear and standardized ways to compose and organise classes and objects. This makes the codebase more maintanable and scalable over time, as changed or additions to the system an be made more easily
            2. Enhance flexibility and extensiblity by allowing the system/s strcucture to evolve without requiring major changed to the exisiting code. This is achieved by decoupling the components of the system and promoting loose coupling between different parts
            3. Improve performance and resource utilization by optimizing the way objects interact and collaborate within the system, thereby enhancing overall system efficiency

        - Overall, these patterna contricute eto building robust, adaptable and well-organized software systemt that are easier to understand, maintain and extend over time
