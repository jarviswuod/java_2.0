/*

    NOTES:
    - Flyweight pattern:
        - Is a structural design pattern that aims to minimize memory usage by sharing common state betweeen multiple objects, allowing efficient handling of large numbers of lightweight objects with shared characteristics


    - CHALLENGE:
        - Say that we have a farming game that includes different types of crops, such as potatoes, carrots and wheat. Each crop is represented by a Crop object, that includes it's X ad Y coordinates, the type of crop, and an icon;

                ______________________
                | Crop               |
                |____________________|
                | x: int             |
                | y: int             |
                | cropType: CropType |
                | icon: byte         |
                |____________________|
