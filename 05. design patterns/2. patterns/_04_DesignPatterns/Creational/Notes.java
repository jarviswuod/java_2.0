/*

    NOTES:
    - Creational design patterns:
        - They focus on the best way to create objects while hiding the creation logic and making the system independent of how it's objects are created, composed, and represented

        - Benefits:
            - Encapsulation of Object Creation
            - Enhanced Flexibility and Extensibility
            - Improved Code Reusability
            - Promotion of Separation of Concerns
            - Support of Dependency Injection
            - Centralized Control over Object Creation
            - Enforcement of Design Pricinples
