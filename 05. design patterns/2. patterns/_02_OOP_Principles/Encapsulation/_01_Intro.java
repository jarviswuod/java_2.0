/*

    NOTES:
    - Encapsulation involves bundling the data or attributes or fields and the methods/behaviours that operate into that data into a single unit
    - It helps in hiding the internal implementations of a class by only exposing the necessary  fucntionalities of a class to the outside world
    
    - Advanced concepts:
        - Encapsulation
        - Abstraction
        - Inheritance
        - Polymorphism
        - Coupling
        - Composition
