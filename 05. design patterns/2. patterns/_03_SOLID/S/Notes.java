    NOTES:
    - A class should have one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility or purpose
    - This principle encourages you to create classes that are more focused and perform one single well-defined task rather than multiple tasks
    - By breaking up classes into smaller more focused units, it makes code easy to understand, maintain and  test
