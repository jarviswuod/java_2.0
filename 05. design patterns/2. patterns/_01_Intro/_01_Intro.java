    NOTES:
    - What Will be covered in the course:
        - OOP principles
        - The solid principles
        - UML
        - All 23 gang of four software design pattern:
            - Types:
                - Creational Patterns: The different ways to create objects
                    1. Abstract Factory
                    2. Builder
                    3. Factory Method
                    4. Prototype
                    5. Singleton

                - Structural Patterns: The relationship between those objects
                    1. Adapter
                    2. Bridge
                    3. Composite
                    4. Decorator
                    5. Facade
                    6. Flyweight
                    7. Proxy

                - Behavioral Patterns: The interaction/ communication between those objects
                    1. Chain of Responsibility
                    2. Command
                    3. Interpreter
                    4. Iterator
                    5. Mediator
                    6. Memento
                    7. Observer
                    8. State
                    9. Strategy
                    10. Template Method
                    11. Visitor

            - What are design Patterns and why learn them?
                1. Reusable solutions
                    - Help promote and provide proven solutions to recurring problems in software design, instead of reinventing the wheel developer can leverage these patterns to solve common issues efficiently, Example;
                        - Undo operation can be achieve by use of Memento pattern

                2. Standardized terminology
                    - Provide a common language for developers to communicate efficiently and effectively about software designs, this common vocub enhances collaboration and understanding between team members

                3. Scalability
                    - Promote scalable designs by proving flexible and adaptable solutions solutions allowing systems to evolve over time without extensive rework or architectural overhaul

                4. Maintainability
                    - Results in more maintainable code as patterns encapsulate design decisions and promote modular loosely coupled architectures making it easier to understand modify and extend code-base

                5. Performance
                    - Some patterns help improve performance by optimizing resource usage, reducing overhead and facilitating efficient algorithms

                6. Documentation
                    - They serve as a form of documentation for software design. By employing well-known patterns designers can convey design intent more effectively making code-base easier to understand for both current and future contributors

                7. Best Practices
                    - They embody best practices and principle of software design, encapsulating years of collective knowledge and experience guiding developers towards more reliable, robust and maintainable solutions

                8. Cross-Domain Applicability
                    - Many patterns are agnostic of programming languages/ domain, meaning they can be used across different programming languages essentially and they can be applied across different technologies and industries making them valuable tools for developers working in diverse environment
