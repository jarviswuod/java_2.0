/*

    NOTES:
    - This is a concept used to reduce the complexity by hiding uncessary details of a class to a user of that class.
        - Example when pressing a button a TV remote, you dont have to worry about all the interraction with the internal circuit board

    - Without abstraction the user needs to know more information and understand the internal logic involved in sending an email, if any of those implementations are changed e.g adding a URL as parameter to any of the methods, then all classes using the email service will then have to change, risking adding bugs to the previously working code. but with abstractions, we just the parameter to one method and we good to go
