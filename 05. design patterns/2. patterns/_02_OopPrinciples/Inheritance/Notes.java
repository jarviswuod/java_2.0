    NOTES:
    - Inheritance involes creating new classes(sub/ derived) based on existing classes (super/ base)
    - Subclasses inherit properties and behaviors from their super classes and can also add new features or override existing ones. Inheritance is often describled in terms of an "is-a" relationship

    - Advantages of inheritance:
        - We don't have to write the commonly used fields and methods for every single Vehicle subclass
        - We can make change(property or method) easily under super class since it's in one place
        - It allows for polymorphism
