/*

    NOTES:
    - Collections:
         - A collection allows a group of objects to be treated as a single unit
         - The Java Collections Framework provides 3 main parts:
             - The core interfaces
             - Concrete classes(Implementations of core interfaces)
             - Static utility methods for sorting, searching, or creating collections

    - Collection heavily leverages the concept of interfaces(core java concept)

    - Map doesn't extend a collection interface List, Set and Queue does
