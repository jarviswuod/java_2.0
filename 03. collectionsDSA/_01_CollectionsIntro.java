/*

    NOTES:
    - Collections:
         - A collection allows a group of objects to be treated as a sungle unit
         - The Java Collections Framework provides 3 main parts:
             - The core interfaces
             - Concrete classes(Implementation of core interfaces)
             - Static utility methods to perform operations as sorting and searching, or creating collections and arrays

    - Collection heavily leverages the concept of interfaces
    - Map doetnot extend a collection interface like List, Set and Queue
    - Interface extending another interface
