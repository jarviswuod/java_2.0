/*

    NOTES:
    - List interface:
        - ArrayList<>();
        - LinkedList<>();
        - Vector<>();


    - List Properties:
        - Can have duplicate elements
        - Can have multiple null elements
        - Maintains insertion order
        - Elements are stored and accessed in orderinal order just like in arrays from index 0
        - 

    
    - difference between arraylist and LinkedList
        - LinkedList implements both List, Queue, and Deque interfaces while ArrayList implements only List
        - LinkedList can be used as a List or Queue while LinkedList can only be used as List
        - LinkedList stores data in double LinkedList while ArrayList stores it data in a dynamic array 
        - LinkedList is fast when it comes to manipulating data(delete, add) while ArrayList is good for storing/ retrieving data
        - LinkedList is larger compared to arrayList because each node stores, element data, and previous and next refes while arrayList just stores the element
        - Accessing data is in constant in ArrayList while it's linear in LinkedList


    - Collection Methods:
        - containsAll()
        - addAll()
        - removeAll()
        - size()
        - isEmpty()
        - 



    - List methods:
        - get()
        - add()
        - contains()
        - remove()
        - add(index, value)
        - isEmpty()
        - size()
        - 


    - Looping through List:
        - basic for loop
        - Enhanced for loop
        - for loop iterator
        - forEach
        -
