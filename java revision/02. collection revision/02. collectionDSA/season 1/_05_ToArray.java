/*

    NOTES:
    - toArray(new Integer[0])
        - You can pass the same size as the arrayList to be converted
        - If you pass a bigger value than the ArrayList, the values will be copied and the remaining spots will be null, NOT a good convention
        - BEST PRACTISE - If you pass a small size than the ArrayList length, then a new Array is created with exactly the same length as the ArrayList
        - Example:
            - Integer[] arr = alist.toArray(new Integer[0]);
