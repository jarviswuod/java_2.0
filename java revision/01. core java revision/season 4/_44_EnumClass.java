    NOTES:
    - Limiting options/choices
    - extends Enum class
    - can implement interfaces but not extends classes
    - == or equals(str) for comparison
    - Can include fields, methods, and constructors
    - Are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`
    - values() to loop and name() or ordinal()
    - private constructor coz all objects are in the class
