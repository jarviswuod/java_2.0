    NOTES:
    - Encapsulation & Access modifiers
        - Encapsulation refers to restricting access to fields and only making them accesible via setters and getters
        - This is achieved via the help of access modifiers

        -  Access Modifiers:
            - public -> method and fields can be access from any where beginning with module level, package
            - private -> only accessible inside the class
            - protected -> accessible via inheritance both within the package and module
            - default -> only accesible inside a package level
