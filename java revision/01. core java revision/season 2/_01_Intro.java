    OFFHEAD NOTES:
     -> javac .java converts java code to byte
     -> java className runs the byte codes in the JVm environment with help of JRE libraries
     -> Jvm looks at all the code byte in search of one file with a signature method to begin execution from(the main method)
     -> signature method - main method -- psvm
     -> Java is a strong OOP language and everything in java is preresented in objects. We create object with help of classes hence the public class _01_Intro

     -> JVM -> Java Virtual Machine
     -> JRE -> Java Runtime Environment
