    ABSTRACT
        - abstract methods must exist under abstract class
        - abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods
        - abstract class can have constructors
        - abstract class cannot be instanciated
        - all abstract methdos must be overrided by the first concrete class
        - abstract class and methods can have public, private, defaulf and protected keywords
    
    interface vs abtract class
        - interface does not have a constructor
        - interface variables static by default
        - interface methods of interfaces are public by default
        - multiple inheritance is not possible for abstract classes, very posible for interface
        - cannot have concrete methods, unless its default or static, possible for abstract
