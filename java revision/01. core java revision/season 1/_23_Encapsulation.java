/*
    NOTES:
        - Encapsulation refers to hiding the internal state (fields/variables) of a class and restricting direct access to them.
        - It secures data by making fields `private` and exposing them through `public` getter/setter methods.
        - This ensures controlled access, improves code maintainability, and enforces data integrity.
        - Encapsulation is one of the core principles of OOP in Java.

 */

/*
   NOTES:
       - DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCESS MODIFIERS AND ENCAPSULATION
       - Encapsulation is a concept; access modifiers are tools used to implement it.

       - In simple terms:
       - Encapsulation = "Hide internal stuff and control access"
       - Access Modifiers = private, public, protected, default â€” used to control visibility
