/*

  AI NOTES:
    - The `static` keyword makes a member belong to the class, not instances.
    - It's mainly used for memory efficiency and shared access.
    - A static method can only access static variables or other static methods.
    - Examples: 
        - Static variable -> static String name = "";
        - Static method -> public static void methodName() { ... }
        - Static block -> static { ... }

 */

/*

  NOTES:
    - If 1000 User objects are created:
    - userCount is stored once.
    - name is stored 1000 times (one per object).
    - This reduces memory use and ensures shared data stays consistent.
