/*

    NOTES:
    - 'super' means, If we ever gonna retrieve elements from a list, it's gonna be given back to the elements inform of Objects ONLY. This is because, complier doesn't know what list you will always be getting, it might be from the highest end, the Object class it's self based on super being set to the lower bound
    - In reality we don't always use 'super' for retrieving values. We use 'extends' keyword instead. This is because with 'extends', can retrieve things as a specific type i.e as a Dog, a Cat or say Animal. In 'super' we do it with Object as we don't know what the type might be
