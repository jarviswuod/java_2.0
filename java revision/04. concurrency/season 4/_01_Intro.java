    NOTES:
    - Multitasking:
        - Referes to the ability of a computer to handle more than one task concurrently

    - Types of multitasking:
        - Process-based multitasking:
            - Refers to action of a computer handling more than one app at a given point

        - Thread-based multitasking:
            - Refers to action of a computer handling multiple threads of a given program at a given time

    - Process and Thread difference:
        - Thread are located within the same memory space
        - Context switching between threads is relatively cheap
        - Communication cost between threads is fairly easy at all threads share the same space

    - Why multithreading:
        - To make good use of computers CPU clock cycle
