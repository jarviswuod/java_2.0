/*

    NOTES:
    - A thread is an independent single unit of execution within a program

    - Thread concepts to learn/explore:
        - Thread creation and code writing i.e code to be executed by the thread
        - Data sharing between different threads through synchronization
        - Different thread states propagation

    - Thread explansion and types:
        - User thread
        - Daemon Thread

    - NOTE:
        - JVM does not terminate it's excetution as long as a user thread is being executed
        - daemon thread can be terminated by JVM termination

    - Thread creation:
        - By implementing the Runnable interface
        - By extending the Thread class
