    NOTES:
    - Structural design pattern:
        - Proxy:
            - Refers to introducing an object to control acess to another object
            - Key players:
                - Subject
                - Real subject
                - Proxy
            - Example:
                - YoutubeDownloadProxy


        - Flyweight:
            - Sharing the same state multiple objects to help save some memory
            - Key players:
                - Flyweight Factory
                - Flyweight class
                - Subsystem classes
            - Example:
                - Farm and CropIcon


        - Facade:
            - Simply complex object interfaces encapsulating complex interactions
            - Key players:
                - Facade interface
                - Concrete facade
                - Object
            - Example:
                - Process Order Request


        - Decorator:
            - Dynamically add a behavior or implementation to an object
            - Key players:
                - Decorator interface
                - Concrete Decorator
                - Component interface
                - Concrete Component
            - Example:
                - Cloud storage

        - Composite:
            - Defeinition of a tree-like structure to represent a collection of objects, individual objects and group of objects are treated as a unified items
            - Key players:
                - Component
                - Leaf
                - Composite
            - Example:
                - Delivery service Pricing


        - Bridge:
            - Is a abstraction and implementation are separeted and grow independently
            - Key players:
                - Abstraction
                - Implementation interface
                - Concrete Implementation
            - Example:
                - Remote control


        - Adapter:
            - Different object interface paired together via a abridge for communication
            - Key players:
                - Target
                - Adapter
                - Adaptee
            - Example:
                - Color editor for video
