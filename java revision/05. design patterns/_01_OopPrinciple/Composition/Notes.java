/*

    NOTES:
    - Combining several little independent classes to form once more complete and complex system
    - Every little class has its own fields and methods in a complete form
    - When you call the main class's method, it delegates roles to the specific classes methods instead of handling it by itself


    - Composition && Inheritance:
    - Fragile class base
    - brittle software
