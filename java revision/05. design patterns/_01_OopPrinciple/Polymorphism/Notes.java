    NOTES:
    - Is the ability of an object to exist in more than one form
            List<Vehicle> list =  new ArrayList<>();
            for(Vehicle vehicle : list) {
                vehicle.start();
            }

    - All possible because all vehicles subclasses are vehicle i.e inherit vehicle traits and perhaps override them
