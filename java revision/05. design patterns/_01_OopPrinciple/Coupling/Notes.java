    NOTES:
    - Refers to level of dependance between different/separate classes
    - High coupling:
        - Tignt coupling, high level of dependancy between classes [ new ClassName() ]

    - Low coupling:
        - Low level of dependence between classes. Achived by applying open-close principle and single resposibility
