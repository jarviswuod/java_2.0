    NOTES:
    - It states that a software entity should be open for extension but closed for modification
    - This reduces bugs introduction into already exising code which makes it easy to understand code, make modifications and easy management

    - Example:
        - Shapes with ShapeType enums and areasCalculation logic using an ifelse statement
