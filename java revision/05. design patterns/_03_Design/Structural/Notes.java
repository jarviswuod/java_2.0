    NOTES:
    - Proxy design pattern:
        - Is a structral pattern that provides an object to control another object allowing for additional functionality without modifying the original object code
        - Key players
            - Subject interface
            - Concrete subject
            - Proxy

        - Example:
            - Video player

    - Flyweight design pattern:
        - Is a structral pattern that provides a common object state that is shared across multiple object states aiming to solve for memory optimization
        - Key players
            - Flyweight Factory
            - Flyweight class
            - Objects

        - Example:
            - Farm game

    - Facade design pattern:
        - Is a structral pattern that provides a simple inteface to interact with a complex system to achieve encapsulation of complex system
        - Key players
            - Facade interface
            - Concrete Facade
            - Subsystem

        - Example:
            - Order processing
