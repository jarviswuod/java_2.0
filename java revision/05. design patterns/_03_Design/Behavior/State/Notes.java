    NOTES:
    - State Pattern:

    - Is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to change it's behavior when it's internal implementation changes

    - 3 state Key players:
        - Context
        - State
        - Concrete state

    - Example:
        - Something that has a state that changes, a doc state with allowance to change based on editor
        - enum Document
        - enum Permission; Admin, Editor, User
