    NOTES:
    - OOP concepts
        - Encapsulation
            - Key:
                - calling the deposit on the constructor
                - Keeping the fields safe and only accessing then via public methods
                - Logic should be kept in mind when creating the public methods
                - Use of IllegalArgumentException

        - Abstraction
            - Hiding uncessary internal implementation from a user and only making accesible the useful ones
            - Making everything private and only making the neccesary required public, this way when the public method is called the internal private methods are all called in accordance
            - 

        - Inheritance
            - tight coupling -> Brittle software

        - Polymorphism
        - Composition
            - COMPOSITION VS INHERITANCE:
                - Fragile-Base class

        - Coupling
            - loose coupling
            - tight coupling

    - Solid Principles:
        - Single Responsibility Principle
        - Open/Closed Principle
        - Liskov Substitution Principle
        - Interface Segregation Principle
        - Dependency Inversion Principle


    - Design Patterns:
        - Creational:
            - These patterns focus on how Objects are created
            - Types:
                - Singleton
                - prototype

        - Structural:
            - These patterns focus on how Objects relate and interact with each other to perform a specific purpose
            - Types:
                - Facade
                - Decorator
                - Builder
                - flyweight

        - Behavioral:
            - These patterns focus on how Objects communicate with each other to accomplish a task
            - Types:
                - ChainOfResponsibility
                - Mediator
                - Momento


    1. Creational
        - AbstractFactory
        - Builder
        - FactoryMethod
        - prototype
        - Singleton

        - Abs-bui-fact-prot-sing


    2. Structural
        - Adapter
        - Bridge
        - Composite
        - Decorator
        - Facade
        - Flyweight
        - Proxy

        - Ada-bri-comp-dec-faca-fly-prox


    3. Behavioral
        - ChainOfResponsibility
        - Command
        - Interpreter
        - Iterator
        - Mediator
        - Momento
        - Observer
        - State
        - Stratergy
        - Template
        - Visitor

        - Chai-comm-int-ite-med-mom-obs-stat-strat-temp-vis


    - Abbreviation:
        - Abs-bui-fact-prot-sing
        - Ada-bri-comp-dec-faca-fly-prox
        - Chai-comm-int-ite-med-mom-obs-stat-strat-temp-vis
