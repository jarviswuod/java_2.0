/*
    OFFHEAD NOTES:
     - javac name.java converts .java to .class(bytes)
     - java name run/executes in JVM which is an environment provided by JRE with the help or libraries

     - JVM searches across all byte files in look for a signature method PSVM to start its execution from
     - why public class, Java is an OOP language and everything is represented in objects form, class helps us create an object

     - JVM -> Java Virtual Machine
     - JRE -> Java Runtime Environment
