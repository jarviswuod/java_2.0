    NOTES:
    - Multitasking
        - Multitasking refers to handling multiple tasks at the same time, can be achieved in computers too.

        - Types of multitasking:
            - Process-based multitasking:
                -  This refers to running multiple programs at the same time on a computer. Example:
                 Operating 2 different apps or programs

            - Thread-based multitasking:
                - This refers to a computer program running multiple threads/parts in parallel. Example Ms Word that is printing and formatting text at the same time


        - Threads vs Process:
            - Threads share the same address space
            - Context switching between threads is usually less expensice than between processes since they share same address
            - The cost of communication between threads is realtively low because of sharing same space address between threads


        - Why MultiThreading?
            - In a single-threaded environment, only one task at a time can be performed wasting CPU cycles
            - Multitasking allows idle CPU time to be put to good use.
