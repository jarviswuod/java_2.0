/*

    NOTES:
       - Encapsulation refers to hiding the internal state (fields/variables) of a class and restricting direct access to them.
       - It secures data by making fields `private` and exposing them through `public` getter/setter methods.
       - This ensures controlled access, improves code maintainability, and enforces data integrity.
       - Encapsulation is one of the core principles of OOP in Java.

/*

    NOTES:
       - DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCESS MODIFIERS AND ENCAPSULATION
       - Encapsulation is a concept; access modifiers are tools used to implement it.

       - In simple terms:
          - Encapsulation = "Hide internal stuff and control access"
          - Access Modifiers = private, public, protected, default â€” used to control visibility
