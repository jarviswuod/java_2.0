01 Intro

Database: Something that stores data 

Relational Database:

Entity: What we store data about: it can be a person, a customer, an order, a client, an employee
Attribute: What we store about a specific related data

We enter specific values for each attribute to make the relation between the attributes and the entity

Rows and Columns:
	Rows: are all attribute values for a specific entity, example: age, height, name, reg_no, address, username
	Column: are all values for a specific attribute type. Example: billy, 1234Pass, 38089372
	
Entity Type and Attribute Type:
	Entity Type is basically the category of the entities that we're storing
	Attribute Type: Are basically categories of attributes; example: username, name, password
	
	
02: Relational Database Management system:
Ability to run fancy queries to give specific results
Allows change in terms of data is presented (View mechanism)
	- Basically different users interacting with database based on their permissions, example admins vs normal user 
Consistency: maintain the frontend consistency
Allows to handle transaction: a transaction is a situation where we either do something either completely all the way or does not work at-all. Example: deducting money from account, adding money to a different account, updating the database, and saving, if something happens before all the events take place then the transaction is canceled and nothing is saved
Example:
	MySQL
	Oracle
	Sqlite
	
Difference between DBMS and rDBMS:



03: Introduction to SQL:
- Sql is a mediator between db and human English
- DB sections:
    - DDL -> Data Definition Language: Used to define database structure
                - CREATE
    - DML -> Data Manipulation Language: Manipulates data between db
                - UPDATE
                - JOIN
                - SELECT



04: What is Database Design:
Data integrity: Is a situation where all data is upto date and no repeating data
- Sections of a database design: More general to more specific
	- Conceptual schemas: How data is related example user and sales table
	- Logical schemas: Structuring out all our columns, our data types, our relationships and finally just make an assumption on security i.e no security flause
	- Physical schemas: What servr are we using, how are people going to access our data? actual programming of the database, build the webform, installing the server and testing, building the users who access the db, what different views we have, what data will be returned, we need to focus on security


Database design:
- This are skills that you know to build a database that is not having data integrity issues, update anomalies
- Is a method to separate information over multiple tables rather than having one huge table to store all information



05: Data Integrity:
- Is having correct data in our database i.e no repeating values, no incorrect values, no broken relationships between tables
- Entity integrity: Unique entities often implemented by different ids. id is used to enforce that is key, basically primary key
- Referential integrity: Foreign key
- Domain integrity: Range of what  values we are storing in a database example, data types, 10 digits, strings, boolean

Data types:
- integer
- text
- date
- 

06: Database terms:
- Data
- Database

- Domain


- Entity
- Attributes/ Columns/ Field
- Relation/ Table/ File
- Tuple/ Rows/ Record/ Entry
- values
- DBdesign
- Schema

07: More Database terms:
- SQL
- DDL
- DML
- SQL keywords:
	- SELECT
- Frontend
- Backend
- Client side
- Server side
- Server side scripting Language
- views
- joins




08: Atomic values:
- Refers to the smallest values that can be stored in a database and makes sense


09: Relationships
- Multiple entities with multiple attibutes connected together
- Types of relationships
	- 1:1 -> One to one
	- 1:N -> One to many
	- M:N -> Many to Many

Intermediary table: A table that connects 2 separate tables in a many to many relationship



09: Introduction to Keys
	Rules of keys:
		- Unique
		- Never changing
		- Never null

	Primary Key Index:
		- 

	Foreign key:
		- Foreign key values can change while primany key values can never change

	Look up table:
		- 
- Super and Candidate keys
- Primary and foreign keys
- Primary and alternate keys
- Surrogate and Natural keys

- Super key is ANY number of columns that forces a row to be unique
- Candidate key is the LEAST number of columns needed to force every row to be unique
- Alternate keys are all the other canditate keys we did not choose as the primary key
- Surrogate and natural keys are categories of primary key
- Natural key is something that is naturally in the table and can be used as a primary key e.g username, email etc
- Surrogate keys are just column that's just added to your database to help identify a primary key e.g user_id, sale_id, comment_id



10: Foreign Keys
- Is a reference to primary key in a sparate table
- Primary keys are what sort each individual tables, while foreign keys are what connect tables and help protect integrity


NOT NULL Foreign Key
- NOT NULL -> Every single row must have a value
- If we require a relationship, we set it as not null it means that every foreign key value for that column is going to have a relationship
- Primary keys are required all the time, they are never changing and never null, foreign keys however are different as we can have them to where they're not required i.e they can be empty




11. Foreign key constraints:
	<-> parent		<-> child
	- ON DELETE		- RESTRICT(NO ACTION)
	- ON UPDATE		- CASCADE
				- SET NULL
				
12. Simple, Composite, Compound and keys:
	- Simple -> pk consists of one column
	- Composite -> pk consists of more than one column
	- Compound -> pk that has multiple columns & they're all keys themselves
	
13. Review and key points:
- Super key
- Candidate key
- Primary key
- Alternate key
- Foreign key


14. Introduction to Entity Relationship Modeling:
	EER - Enhanced Entity Relationship Model
	ERD - Enhanced Relationship Diagram
	ER Model - Entity Relationship Model


15. Cardinality:
- Is the relationship type between row of one table and row or rows of another table
 	one to one   |---------------|
 	one to many  |---------------<
 	many to one  <---------------|



16. Modality:
- Is weather or not a relationship is required

 	one to one   |--------------0-|
 	one to one   |--------------|-|  [NN- required]
 	one to many  |--------------0-<
 	one to many  <--------------|-<  [NN- required]


17. Introduction to Database Normalization
- Is the process of going through our database plan we have and start correcting things that might cause data integrity problems or repeating data
- Is a checklist that you have to follow to end up with a good design db

1 Normalization Form
2 Normalization Form
3 Normalization Form


18. First Normal Form of Database Normalization:
- Address -> Can be separated and broken down into columns
- emails -> Multiple emails in one email column
- duplicate data -> Same values for the column with only one email difference
