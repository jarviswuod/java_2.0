01 Intro

Database: Something that stores data 

Relational Database:

Entity: What we store data about: it can be a person, a customer, an order, a client, an employee
Attribute: What we store about a specific related data

We enter specific values for each attribute to make the relation between the attributes and the entity

Rows and Columns:
	Rows: are all attribute values for a specific entity, example: age, height, name, reg_no, address, username
	Column: are all values for a specific attribute type. Example: billy, 1234Pass, 38089372
	
Entity Type and Attribute Type:
	Entity Type is basically the category of the entities that we're storing
	Attribute Type: Are basically categories of attributes; example: username, name, password
	
	
02: Relational Database Management system:
Ability to run fancy queries to give specific results
Allows change in terms of data is presented (View mechanism)
	- Basically different users interacting with database based on their permissions, example admins vs normal user 
Consistency: maintain the frontend consistency
Allows to handle transaction: a transaction is a situation where we either do something either completely all the way or does not work at-all. Example: deducting money from account, adding money to a different account, updating the database, and saving, if something happens before all the events take place then the transaction is canceled and nothing is saved
Example:
	MySQL
	Oracle
	Sqlite
	
Difference between DBMS and rDBMS:



03: Introduction to SQL:
- Sql is a mediator between db and human English
- DB sections:
    - DDL -> Data Definition Language: Used to define database structure
                - CREATE
    - DML -> Data Manipulation Language: Manipulates data between db
                - UPDATE
                - JOIN
                - SELECT



04: What is Database Design:
Data integrity
- Conceptual
- Logical
- Physical
