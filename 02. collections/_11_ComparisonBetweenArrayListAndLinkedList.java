/*

    NOTES:
    ArrayList vs LinkedList
        - ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements, while LinkedList uses a doubly linked list to store the elements

        - Manipulation with ArrayList is slow coz it internally uses a dynamic array. If you are using an LinkedList to store elements that are frequently added or removed

        - ArrayList consumes less memory than LinkedList. LinkedList requires more memory to store the pointers to the next and previous elements along with the data

        - An ArrayList class act as a list only because it implements List only. LinkedList class can act as a list and queue BOTH because it implements List, Queue and Deque interfaces

        - ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data, while LinkedList is better for manipulating data
