/*
 * ArrayList and LinkedList Differences
 * 1. ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements, while LinkedList uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
 * 2.Manipulation with ArrayList is slow coz it internally uses a dynamic array. If you are using an ArrayList to store elements that are frequently added or removed
 * 3. ArrayList consumes less memory than LinkedList. LinkedList requires more memory to store the pointers to the next and previous elements along with the data.
 * 4. An AraayList class act as a list onlyu because it impleements List only. LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List, Queue and Deque interfaces.
 * ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data, while LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
